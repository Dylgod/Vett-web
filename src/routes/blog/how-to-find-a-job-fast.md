I'll get right to the point. If you're reading this, you need a job <u>**_right now_**</u> and you're here to find out how to make that happen. Rest assured that while we do recommend our own software, this article is meant to be a useful resource to anyone.

## Step 1 - Resume

If you don't have one already, prepare a resume (sometimes called a CV, depending on where you're from.) If you need help with your resume there are great free resources to help you get that squared away. [This Reddit Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/) has tons of examples and pleasant people that you can learn from. The sidebar links to this [Resume Writing Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/index/faq/) which is an excellent resource.

### **Warning: <u>DO NOT</u> use ChatGPT to write your resume.** 
I know it's tempting, but this is not the "*trick the hiring manager doesn't want you to know about.*" Every large company uses tools to detect AI generated resumes now. Don't do this unless you want to be looking for a job forever.

## Step 2 - Profiles

There are a myriad of websites where jobs get posted every single day. This includes work from home jobs, hybrid jobs, and remote jobs (which people confuse with work from home, but they are a bit different.) The best ones in the US are:
- Linkedin
- Indeed

You will need to thoroughly fill out a profile on each of these platforms, and upload your resume. Upon submitting an application through any of these sites the employer will inevitably look at your profile, so the effort you put into it will pay off.

## Step 3 - Application Time

Now comes the part I warned you about at the start.

 Here, you have two choices. On the one hand, you have Shy Apply, an automated desktop application that will let you fill out a single job application and make sure it gets into the hands of thousands of hiring managers. On the other hand, you can accomplish the same thing manually by searching for a job title or description on any of the sites I mentioned above, and manually applying to each one. Unfortunately there is no way around this, you have to put your resume into the hands of as many hiring managers as you can.

### **It's a numbers game**

Today's job market has hundreds, sometimes thousands, of applicants for each position. The only way to increase your chances is to make yourself look like a great applicant, and then fill out *a lot* of applications.
