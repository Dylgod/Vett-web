## When the pressure is on

The rent is due, your wallet is thin, and the fridge is looking bare. We've all been there. Finding a regular job takes time, but fast temp jobs can be the bridge between you and your next paycheck. These gigs won't make you rich, but they offer immediate work, often with same-day pay.

Where do you find these quick cash injections? Think about what's always in demand: muscle, hustle, and a helping hand. Moving companies are constantly hiring, eager to put your strength to good use. Delivery services thrive on speed and efficiency, perfect for those who know their city like the back of their hand. And let's not forget the service industry; restaurants and event spaces are always on the lookout for extra hands, no experience needed.

## Why not apply to a 'normal' job?

The beauty of fast temp jobs lies in their flexibility. Work a few shifts this week, find something better next week. It's a side hustle on your terms, allowing you to get through the financial panic. The challenge is finding the job quickly enough to fix your situation. If you're between a rock and a hard place, you really have only one choice: Mass applications.

## How do I blanket applications?

Applying online to all of the available temp jobs you can find does work, but it's limited in speed. It's rare that an employer will respond to a webform within 24 hours, or over the weekend, or a holiday...

Which means, unfortunately, you're left with a mix of online applications and old-fashioned phone calls. Call every high-turnover job you can find (some good examples above) and explain that you're ready to work immediately, and you won't let them down. Often, this is enough when an employer is desperate for a warm body to answer the phones or to take the other end of the couch.


## What about temp agencies?

Temp agencies in your area can be a good place to go if you're frequently looking for this type of work. However, it's important to bear in mind that temp agencies work quickly for the employer, not for you. They have no obligation, or even interest, in finding you a job quickly. They are only interested in filling seats for their real client - the employer that you will ultimately be helping out.
