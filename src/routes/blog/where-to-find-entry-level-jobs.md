## A Fresh Start 

You're fresh out of the gate, diploma gleaming. Problem is, everyone wants experience.  Don't despair. Entry level jobs exist. You just need to know where to look. 

First, ditch the scattergun approach.  Generic job boards are a black hole. Target your search. Identify companies that excite you, or at least seem to offer a chance at professional growth. Big or small, they all need fresh blood. Check their websites directly for career sections.

## Don't be afraid to network
Reach out to people in your field, X (formerly twitter) is great for this, but Linkedin can work as well. Remember, everyone you reach out to was once exactly where you are now.

## Try the side door
Many companies use internship as their top of funnel for recruiting so you should take advantage of internship opportunities at any company that piques your interest. Volunteering is another way to show initiative and builds skills, but make sure you take the time to make some connections and get references! Even temp agencies can provide valuable experience and contacts if you go into it with the right mindset. 

*Pro Tip!* There are great boards specifically for internships, like [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/l/Top-Summer-Internships)

**Every job is a stepping stone, even if it's not your dream gig**. 

## Just Go Fill Out Lots of Applications

Finally, embrace the online world. Niche job boards cater to specific industries or experience levels.  LinkedIn is your friend, not just for connections, but for job postings too. Polish your profile, highlight skills, and be active.  Finding that first job takes hustle, but with persistence, you'll land it.
