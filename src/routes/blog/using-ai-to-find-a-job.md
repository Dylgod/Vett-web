## Is it a good idea?

First off, AI is a tool with limitations just like any other. It is not a panacea or silver bullet. However, it can give you superpowers if used wisely.

## How can AI help me find a job?

There are a myriad of ways you can use AI for this. It can write your cover letter, it can help craft the perfect bullet points to highlight your skills and experience, and even fill out the monotonous forms of the job applications themselves. Each of these requires meticulous monitoring, as AI can hallucinate and cause you some headaches.

**You *Must* read everything that is generated. *Never* blindly trust it. The AI can, and occasionally will, tell outright lies about your skills or experience that can land you in hot water.**

## What about filling out applications?

This is where Shy Apply comes in. We've fine-tuned our tools to use real human logic and to detect questions and answer pairs. In short, we make sure the AI can only use the information it has within a very narrow scope. It will never pretend you have 20 years of work experience at 18, for example.

The benefit of this is that you can fill out unlimited applications, and quickly. No more waiting months to land interviews because you have to manually fill out paperwork every day. That's all in the past now.

## Which AI tools should I use?

This space is moving quickly, so you will want to periodically check in to see what the latest advancements are. As of now, [Google's Gemini Pro](https://aistudio.google.com/) is by far the best at generating cover letters and written responses for interview-style questions. OpenAI hallucinates like it's licking toads in the Amazon.

Gemini can also feed in your experience and it can give you reasonable guidance on how to best capture that in bullet points for your resume, or a summary. As always, be careful that it's being truthful. 

## [Insert AI Tool] Looks like a scam!

There are scams out there. Without naming names, we can say with confidence that the vast majority of "auto apply" tools like ours are basically ChatGPT wrappers with no guard rails. The reviews (on third party websites and reddit, never trust their own reviews!) say it all. 

**Shy Apply offers a free trial so you can test it out for yourself.** We *strongly recommend* you start there if you have any doubts. We also recommend you read our [User Guide](/guide) to understand how to make the most of our tool before you spend any money!
